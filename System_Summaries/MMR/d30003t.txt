Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, calling it a case of ``international meddling.''``Depending on the result of the appeals it is possible that it (the extradition request) will never reach the government so perhaps the government will never have to pronounce on it,'' Aznar was quoted as saying in Wednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper El Pais.A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil.Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct.  at the instigation of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.
