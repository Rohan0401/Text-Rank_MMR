Italy's Communists on Sunday voted to withdraw support for Premier Romano Prodi's  --year-old coalition, a move expected to trigger the collapse of one of the country's longest-lived postwar governments.The coalition has a majority without the Communists in the Senate, but has depended on them for passage of key legislation in the Chamber.Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party, provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting  budget, which is key to Italy's participation in the European common currency.He said the party's desertion of Prodi was ``wrong and dangerous,'' but at the same time promised to follow the party line.
