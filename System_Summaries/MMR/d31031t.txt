House and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday to require most federal health plans to cover prescription contraceptives for women, giving an unusual victory on Capitol Hill to advocates of abortion rights.But the future of the measure was in doubt because it was attached to a spending bill that includes a controversial provision regarding the Federal Election Commission.That provision could scuttle the spending bill, which would finance the Treasury Department and the Postal Service and which still must be approved by the House and Senate.But the opponents of abortion were furious about the approval and persuaded Republican leaders to have negotiators reopen discussion on the matter.
