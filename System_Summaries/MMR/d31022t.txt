A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least  people and injuring about .``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio, describing the sight when rescuers first entered the building in Goteborg, a city of half a million people on the country's west coast.The crowd in the second story of the building contained mostly  to  year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend.``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
