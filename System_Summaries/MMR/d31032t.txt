President Boris Yeltsin has suffered minor burns on his right hand, his press office said Thursday.During his visits to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan this week, Yeltsin is expected to discuss improving Russia's relations with the two former Soviet republics, whose economies have suffered residual effects of the crisis that hit Russia after it devalued its currency in August and defaulted on some of its debt.It said his absence from the Kremlin during the current economic crisis ``amounts to a state catastrophe'' and called on Yeltsin to immediately surrender most of his powers to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.The health of the president, who is also commander-in-chief of the Russian military, ``is a direct threat to the country's national security and a factor of serious concern regarding Russia's nuclear weapons,'' he said.
