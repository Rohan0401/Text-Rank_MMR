A Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast faces an uncertain future following the detention in Rome of its founder and leader.His presence in Europe could also be a blessing in disguise for the group, forcing the PKK to transform itself from a rebel army into a political movement.There is a fair amount of sympathy for the Kurds in Europe, and if the movement gains political momentum, Turkey could come under more pressure from its western allies to grant the Kurds minority rights.``Italy knows what the fate of the Kurdish rebel will be if he falls into the hands of the Turkish military regime,'' said an editorial Saturday in the Greek daily Eleftherotypia.
